//javascript Operators Assign two numeric variables a and b Initialise values as 5 and 10
// respectively and console log in same order the following:

//Create a variable add and assign it the sum of a and b.
//Create a variable sub and assign it result of b subtracted from a.
//Create a variable mul and assign it the product of a and b.
//Create a variable div and assign it the result of of a divided by b.
//Create a variable inc and assign it the preincremented value of a.
//Create a variable dec and assign it the predecremented value of b.

const a = 12;
const b = 13;
console.log(a+b);// adding
console.log(a-b);//subtract
console.log(a*b);//multiply
console.log(a/b);//divide
console.log (++a);//preincement
console.log(--b);//predecremented
